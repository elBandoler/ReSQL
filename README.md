# ReSQL
A MySQL/MariaDB wrapper (?) for C# (dotnet). It just works, that doesn't mean it's good.<br>
This library was programmed a long time ago, after I used a similar library: <a href="https://github.com/oversight-group/ossql">OsSql</a>.<br>
OsSql had some issues with whatever I was trying to do back then, and its code was a bit complicated to go through it.<br>
Therefore I just made my own implementation of the same general idea from scratch.<br>
I might have looked in OsSql for ideas and variable names every now and then, but I'm quite sure all of the code I wrote is my own.<br>
Please don't sue ðŸ˜…

## Why use this?
Well, I'm not sure you should.<br>
In 2021, you have EF Core, alongside NoSQL options such as MongoDB.<br>
ReSQL should be used just if you want a simpler way of dealing with MySQL, and you **insist** on MySQL.<br>
You should still try other options, if you can, as they have better support and probably work well.

## How do I use this?
You can check code examples under the `ReSQLTest` folder.<br>
I'm not even sure they work anymore, but until there's a Wiki, that's the only alternative to testing it yourself.

## Disclaimer
I do not take any responsibility for mistakes in this code, no matter how destructible they might be.<br>
You should always check the code, test it and run it many, many times, to make sure there are no issues.<br>
This is an **old library** which I'm not sure I will ever support due to the lack of time and since I don't use it anymore.<br>
I might, however, add an *actual* wiki in the future.
